# Naming and organizing movie files

The scanners and metadata agents used by Plex will work best when your major
types of content are separated from each other. We _strongly_ recommend
separating movie and television content into separate main directories. For
instance, you might use something like this:

    /Media
       /Movies
          movie content
       /Music
          music content
       /TV Shows
          television content

**Warning!** : Plex will do its best to appropriately find and match content.
However, a failure to separate content such as movies and TV shows may result
in unexpected or incorrect behavior.

In the above example, it is the main folder of each type of content (e.g.
`/Movies`, `/Music`, `/TV Shows`) that you would specify as the content
location for that library type.

You might have your own image files for movie posters & backgrounds,
subtitles, your own movie "extras", etc. To use these, ensure they are named
and organized, and that the Local Media Assets source is enabled and ordered
correctly.

Movies](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200220677-local-media-assets-movies/)

**Note** : We use `.ext` as a generic file extension in the naming/organizing
instructions. You should use appropriate file extension for your files, of
course. (Some operating systems such as Windows may [hide your file
extensions](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/show-file-extensions-in-windows) by
default.)

## Movies in Their Own Folders

Movie files can be placed into individual folders and this is the recommended
method, as it can (sometimes significantly) increase the speed of scanning in
new media. This method is also useful in cases where you have external media
for a movie (e.g., custom poster, external subtitle files, etc.). Name the
folder the same as the movie naming:

* /Movies/MovieName (release year)/MovieName (release year).ext

  /Movies
  /Avatar (2009)
  Avatar (2009).mkv
  /Batman Begins (2005)
  Batman Begins (2005).mp4
  Batman Begins (2005).en.srt
  poster.jpg

So long as you're using the current "Plex Movie" metadata agent for the
library, you can also include the IMDb or TheMovieDB ID number in curly braces
to help match the movie. It must follow the form `{[source]-[id]}`.

    /Movies
       /Batman Begins (2005) {imdb-tt0372784}
          Batman Begins (2005) {imdb-tt0372784}.mp4
    
    
    /Movies
       /Batman Begins (2005) {tmdb-272}
          Batman Begins (2005) {tmdb-272}.mp4

## Stand-Alone Movie Files

If you wish, you can also put movie files next to each other in a main folder.
While this is supported, we do still recommend having the movies in individual
folders as outlined above.

The structure isn’t particularly important unless you have local media assets
like posters or subtitles for a particular movie (in which you should have the
movie and assets together in an individual folder, as outlined above). To
correctly name a movie file, name it as follows:

* MovieName (release year).ext

  /Movies
  Avatar (2009).mkv
  Batman Begins (2005).mp4

## Multiple Editions

**Tip!** : The ability to specify different editions for a movie requires a
[Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) subscription for Plex Media Server
admin account.

In cases where you have a specific movie edition (Theatrical release,
Director's Cut, Extended Edition, Unrated, etc.) or even multiple editions,
you can specify that edition information by appropriately naming the file
and/or folder. This is only available when using the (non-"legacy") Plex Movie
agent available in Plex Media Server v1.28.1 and newer

To do so, you add the edition information inside curly braces to help
distinguish the movie. It must follow the form `{edition-[Edition Name]}`. You
can specify whatever normal text you want for the edition name (with a max
limit of 32 characters).

In cases where you group your movie files together (not within individual
folders for each movie), you'll need to make sure the files are named
appropriately.

    /Movies
       Avatar (2009).mkv
       Blade Runner (1982).mp4
       Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut}.mp4
       Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}.mkv
       Top Gun (1986).mkv

If you are following our recommendation to use individual folders per movie,
you can add the edition name to either the folder or filename or both. For
consistency, we recommend including the edition information in both the folder
name and the filename. This can also be used along with the `{[source]-[id]}`
tag mentioned previously. The order of the tags is unimportant.

    /Movies
       /Blade Runner (1982)
          Blade Runner (1982).mp4
       /Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut}
          Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Director's Cut}.mp4
       /Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}
          Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}.mkv

**Note** : If you're also providing your own [local trailers or extras
files](https://support.plex.tv/articles/local-files-for-trailers-and-extras/)
and you have multiple editions for the movie, you'll want to use individual
folders for each edition and then place the local extras files in whichever
edition you choose to be the "main" one. (Or you could also copy the extras
and place them alongside each edition.)

## Movies Split Across Multiple Files

**Warning!** : While Plex does have limited support for content split across
multiple files, it is not the expected way to handle content. Doing this may
negatively impact usage of various Plex features (including, but not limited
to, preview thumbnails, chapter images, audio/subtitle stream selection across
parts, and more). We recommend users instead join the files together (see
below).

Movies that are split into several files (e.g., pt1, pt2), can be played back
as a single item (in most, but not all, players) if named correctly. The split
parts must be placed inside their own folder, named as usual for the movie.
Name the files as follows:

* /Movies/MovieName (release year)/MovieName (release year) – Split_Name.ext

Where `Split_Name` is one of the following:

* cdX
* discX
* diskX
* dvdX
* partX
* ptX

…and you replace `X` with the appropriate number (cd1, cd2, etc.).

    /Movies
       /The Dark Knight (2008)
          The Dark Knight (2008) - pt1.mp4
          The Dark Knight (2008) - pt2.mp4

**Notes** :

* Not all Plex apps support playback of stacked media
* All parts must be of the same file format (e.g., all MP4 or all MKV)
* All parts should have identical audio and subtitle streams in the same order
* Only stacks up to 8 parts are supported
* "Other Videos" libraries or those using the "Plex Video Files Scanner" do not support stacked content.
* Not all features will work correctly when using "split" files.
